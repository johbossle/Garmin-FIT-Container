This repository is a collection of Garmin FIT Perl library and scripts for
converting Garmin FIT files to other formats.  
Currently the following conversions are supported:

Main library for reading and parsing Garmin FIT file is a modified/updated
version of [Garmin::FIT library] by Kiyokazu Suto. If you want to update
Garmin::FIT library to the latest protocol/profile, use documentation from
the official [FIT SDK] from [thisisant.com] Web site.

Currently supported FIT protocol and profile in this version of library is:

FIT Protocol | FIT Profile  | Released
------------ |:------------ |:------------
2.4          | 21.32        | 28-May-2020

Some of the messages and fields used in this implementation are not described
in the latest official [FIT SDK] documentation and are therefore
experimental/unsupported. This implementation was tested on FIT files from
Garmin Edge device only. Other devices might produce FIT files which don't
have all required fields. Scripts work in both Windows and Unix environments.
Support for 64-bit integers is not tested at all.

Conversion scripts need to be run from the command line (there's no GUI).

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following Perl prerequisites:
- POSIX::strftime::GNU
- Data::UUID
- Config::Simple

You can install them with **ppm** on Windows (if you are using ActivePerl) or
with **cpan**:  
<pre>
$ cpan install POSIX::strftime::GNU  
$ cpan install Data::UUID  
$ cpan install Config::Simple
</pre>

### Conversion
#### Getting the FIT files

You have to copy FIT files from your Garmin (or other) device to your computer.
You'll need the **activity FIT files** only. On Garmin Edge devices these
files are stored in \Garmin\Activity subdirectory. You can also do it via 
[Garmin Connect Export option].

#### Config (ini) file

All conversion scripts can optionaly use config file in [Windows **ini** format],
which must be named as the script name with extension ***.ini*** and must
reside in the current working directory. If the config file is not found, some
reasonable defaults are applied.

Config file example (**fit2slf.ini**):
<pre>
[default]
;SigmaSport: cycling, mountainbike, racing_bycicle (road bike), running, ...
sport = mountainbike
training_type = Riding
bike = bike1

[personal]
name = John Smith
gender = male
age = 40
height = 183
weight = 75

[bike1]
name = Ibis Ripley 29 LS
type = MTB
weight = 12.3
wheel_size = 2326
</pre>
Units used in config file and in scripts are metric (kg, cm, mm, ...).

Detailed syntax and parameters used in **ini** file is described in
[Config (ini) File Syntax].

#### FIT to GPX (GPS Exchange Format)

Use **fit2gpx.pl** with optional config file **fit2gpx.ini**:
<pre>
$ fit2gpx.pl input.fit
</pre>
This produces file ```input.gpx``` in the current directory. If the file
```input.gpx``` already exists, it will not be overwritten. To force overwrite,
use:
<pre>
$ fit2gpx.pl -y input.fit
</pre>
By default a GPX file compatible with [Garmin's Track Point Extension Format v1]
is produced. If you want to produce a GPX file compatible with a
[Cluetrust GPX Extension Format], use the following:
<pre>
$ fit2gpx.pl -c input.fit
</pre>
Difference between them is in the syntax how heart rate, cadence, temperature &
power data is stored in the file. In both cases a Cluetrust extension
**&lt;gpxdata:lap&gt;** (one for each lap) will be added to the end of file,
where the following average/min/max values are stored:

*startPoint, endPoint, startTime, elapsedTime, calories, distance, avg_speed,
max_speed, min_altitude, avg_altitude, max_altitude, total_ascent, total_descent,
distance_uphill, distance_downhill, avg_incline_uphill, avg_incline_downhill,
avg_rise_rate_uphill, avg_rise_rate_downhill, min_heart_rate, max_heart_rate,
min_percent_hrmax, avg_percent_hrmax, max_percent_hrmax, time_under_target_zone,
time_in_target_zone, time_over_target_zone, avg_power, avg_power_KJ,
avg_power_W_per_Kg, max_power, avg_cadence, max_cadence, min_temperature,
avg_temperature, max_temperature, total_cycles, total_records*

If ```input.fit``` contains power data from power meter, the real power
average will be used instead of calculated one.

#### FIT to SLF (SigmaSport log file)

Use **fit2slf.pl** with optional config file **fit2slf.ini**:
<pre>
$ fit2slf.pl input.fit
</pre>
This produces file ```input.slf``` in the current directory. If the file
```input.slf``` already exists, it will not be overwritten. To force overwrite,
use:
<pre>
$ fit2slf.pl -y input.fit
</pre>
A lot of calculation of average/min/max values is done in addition to the
data found in FIT file. Specifically, power is calculated according to the
formulas described in J.C. Martin's paper
[Validation of a Mathematical Model for Road Cycling Power]
from 1998. You can change some of the parameters used for power calculation
in **ini** file (see [Config (ini) File Syntax]). If ```input.fit``` contains
power data from power meter, the real power measurements will be used instead
of calculated ones.

Resulting ```input.slf``` can be directly imported in [SigmaSport Data Center],
which is a perfect software for **offline** evaluation of cycling statistics
and training sessions.

#### FIT to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Use **fitdump.pl**:
<pre>
$ fitdump.pl -print_json=1 input.fit > input.json
</pre>
If you want to include the units, which are switched off by default for JSON,
add command line switch ```-without_unit=0```.

#### FIT to Text dump

**fitdump.pl** reads the contents for Garmin .FIT files given on command line
(or standard input if no file is specified), and prints them in human readable
form. Usage:
<pre>
$ fitdump.pl input.fit > input.txt
or
$ cat input.fit | fitdump.pl > input.txt
</pre>
The following command line switches are available (see example for JSON above):
<pre>
-semicircles_to_deg=(0|1)       default: 1
-mps_to_kph=(0|1)               default: 1
-use_gmtime=(0|1)               default: 0
-maybe_chained=(0|1)            default: 0
-print_json=(0|1)               default: 0
-without_unit=(0|1)             default: 0 (1 for print_json)
-skip_invalid=(0|1)             default: 0 (1 for print_json)
-numeric_date_time=(0|1)        default: 0
-show_version=(0|1)             default: 0
</pre>
Fields in .FIT files, which are not documented in [FIT SDK], are named as
```unknown<field_number>```. New fields, which typically appear in newer
versions of FIT Profiles and [Garmin::FIT library] doesn't know them yet,
are named as ```xxx<field_number>```.

**fitdump.pl** is written in a generic way and will read all versions of
.FIT files (past and future).
